# RotaryDial
A very simple but beautiful rotary dialer app.
If you want some nostalgia without having to sacrifice the consistent
Material Design of the Android platform, this app is for you.

## About the App
This app started as a personal learning project for me in creating
custom views. The first result turned out quite good and I thought, why
not open-source it and put it on the Play Store just for the kicks?
So here it is, have fun with it!

## Updates
I might extend the functionality of the app in the future, or I might
not. As stated above, this is primarily a personal learning project,
so no promises! If you want to add something to it for any reason, feel
free to fork and send me a pull request.
